### Description

    Our Project is based on an original idea which we thought of that would automate things in our life. 

    The idea behind this project was to automate video to summarized text conversion.

    In this project first: 

        1)We take a youtube link as an input from the user.
        2)Also we take the number of sentences in summarized text as an input from the user.
        3)Then it is converted into a audio file.
        4)Convert the audio file to text file.
        5)Punctuate the text.
        6)Summarize the punctuated text.
        7)Display the output in GUI.

### Visuals

    We have added screenshots of the output of our project.

### Modules used in the project:

    For downloading youtube video:
        youtube-dl

    For video to text conversion:
        Speech_recognition
        Moviepy.editor

    For text summarization:
        Nltk
        Numpy
        Networkx

    For GUI:

FUTURE SCOPE:
    We wish to host aur project.Also we can replace the text-to-summarization algorithum with a more complex one.We can also use Abstractive Summarization with the help of machine learning models.
